## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
* I struggled with adding images to the gameCard element. At first I had not properly put the image element and when I had that figured out I made an error of using the wrong variable name when referencing the image address and the name and descruption of the game. The Slack group was also really helpful with nudging me towards the right direction.
* It took me a bit of time to understand some of the instructions, especially the one about using the ternary operator to display the correct grammar, and this was partially due to premature interpretation of the instructions while reading. Once I slowed down more and took the time to understand the instructions I was able to proceed with more ease. 
* Early on in the prework I struggled with moving on to the next section as I kept getting an incorrect key. Reading through the linked resources was super helpful for learning new information and refreshing learned information.
